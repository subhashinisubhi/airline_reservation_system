# airline_reservation_system
A reservation system for airlines handles a variety of flight-related activities. In this project, you will be able to book flights through a web-based flight reservation system. Nevertheless, the Airlines Reservation System simplifies the booking process and provides both travel agencies and consumers with assistance.

In the past, all activities had been performed manually, which was time consuming and costly. With this reservation system, you will be able to make reservations, cancel reservations, as well as view a list of passengers. As a result, it simplifies and accelerates the work process.
